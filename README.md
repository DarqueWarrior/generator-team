## July 2017

### 0.3.5

Merge [Pull Request](https://github.com/DarqueWarrior/generator-team/pull/7) from [Daniel Meixner](https://github.com/DanielMeixner) which included the following:

### 0.3.4

Fixed bug in Java Docker Build

### 0.3.3

Fixed spelling error

## June 2017

### 0.3.1

Fixed dependencies so users do not need Mocha installed.

### 0.3.0

.NET Core

- Migrated .net core to csproj and updated all references.
- The Hosted build pool is no longer supported for the .NET Core project. The upgrade to csproj is not supported on Hosted. Use HostedVS2017, Hosted Linux or private agent.
- Removed Code coverage from .NET Core because solution was not cross-platform. It only worked on Windows agents.

Node.js

- Fixed issue with Node.js code coverage.

Java, Node.js & .NET Core

- Adding support for running [Docker images in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-linux-using-custom-docker-image). Working with Product team to see why images initial load takes so long.

Release Defs

- Updated task versions
- The following task were not updated due to breaking changes:
- Azure Resource Group Deployment
- Azure App Service Deploy

General

- Updated generator npm dependencies.

## March 2017

### 0.2.5

Updated the Azure Resource Manager Service Endpoints to work with the Azure Portal Continuous Delivery feature.
Fixed bug in Azure sub generator that asked for information not needed when using VSTS.

### 0.2.4

Fixed some issues with TFS after locking versions for VSTS. Some of the build templates were used for both and locking versions caused issues on TFS.

### 0.2.3

Added Full .NET Framework support but only for Azure App Service.

### 0.2.2

Locked Tasks to specific version. This will prevent auto updates from breaking builds and releases.

Changed release template for PaaS to include Web Performance Test.

Changed release to default to latest version of build for manual releases.

Changed ARM templates to add unique string after Website Name.  This will help make sure final website URL is globally unique.

ASP sub generator only supports .net core 1.0 RC2. RC 3 and above switched to CSPROJ.  yo Team uses hosted agents as lowest common denominator and we will update as soon as CSPROJ is supported on hosted agents.

## February 2017

### 0.2.1

Fixed a bug in the App Service deployment after adding ACR support.

### 0.2.0

Has breaking changes from previous version.  Removed the email parameter for Docker Registries and added support for Azure Container Registry.  Now you can use [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/).

## January 2017

### 0.1.3

Improved build names from just build id to build definition name plus build id

### 0.1.2

Added User-Agent Header to request so calls could be identified by VSTS Team telemetry.

### 0.1.0

Initial release
